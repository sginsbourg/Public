About The Services:

Performance and load testing is a set of Quality Assurance (QA) activities for loading, monitoring, and analyzing complex software systems. It is the industry standard procedure for validating performance requirements at the system level under normal and anticipated peak load conditions. This validation is best performed by measuring responses while stressing the System under Test (SUT). The analysis of such test results is required for verifying the performance envelope and for stating the operating capacity of any software application, as well as pinpointing any virtual or physical bottlenecks that might root-cause service degradation.

The ultimate goal of Ginsbourg.com is to deliver a powerful and reliable service suite, which allows IT teams to continuously quality control their systems. As part of these activities, scripts and scenarios are especially engineered in order to test the performance of websites and web applications. The same scripts and scenarios can later be reused for ongoing performance monitoring once the website and web applications are launched.

Performance and load testing may be performed with various professional tools: Open-source free 'Apache-JMeter', budget 'SOASTA integrated Software Quality Suite' (named a leader in Gartner's report), luxurious industry standard 'HP LoadRunner', 'Microsoft Visual Studio Load Test Virtual User Pack', and other acknowledged on-premise software packages or open-source free solutions.

With professional performance and load testing, you assure the availability of your websites and web applications, to provide optimal efficiency and customer satisfaction.
